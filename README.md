### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Oslo, Norway. I've been interested in computers, electronics and coding since I was a child, and received my formal education in Computer Engineering from the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science in Binghamton, NY.

I started my career in 2008 in New York City and worked for 10 years before moving to Oslo in 2018.
